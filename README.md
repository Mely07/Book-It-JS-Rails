Book-It is a test-prep application, for students grade 9 to 12, that provides a space for users to find and share honest reviews for test-prep books. It is a single page application built using CSS and Javascript on the frontend communicating with a Ruby on Rails built API backend. Students can post new books, comment on existing books, and like each other’s book reviews.
